Its grandeur of scale, complex architectural composition, and variety of detailing, purpose designed embellishments, and inlaid decorations, add to its representative architectural value and provide important evidence of the history of aesthetics, and of a philosophy of design which embraced progressive ideas on taste and lifestyle. The physical survival of that evidence in the buildings fabric (and setting) contributes significantly to an understanding of the spread and evolution of the Queen Anne style outside of England. Rymill House is also a testament to the ability of its architect, John Haslam, in interpreting and adapting the English style to local conditions. It is one of the largest local examples of his work to survive and the best of only a few of the architectural type and style in Adelaide. It was one of the last great residences to be built in late 19th century Adelaide before the economic crash and decades long recession which followed. Rymill House is also significant for its highly unusual attribute of being designed to be viewed 'in the round'. It has as a consequence, an enhanced degree of unity in its relationship to its setting, and a 'set-piece' quality that is reminiscent of the baronial manors of 'Old England'. The interior of Rymill House is significant for the remarkable diversity of its ornamentation and detailing, a feature of the Queen Anne style. Rymill House has high historical significance due to both its place in the development of architecture in South Australia and its association with the Rymills - a prominent South Australian family.

Designed by Inspector of Public Works and Buildings / Government Architect George Strickland Kingston, and intended to meet the colony's future as well as immediate needs, the 34,000 pounds project was criticised as lavish and extravagant. It contributed to the colony's bankruptcy in 1840, and the consequent replacement of George Gawler as Governor the following year. The panopticon design, emulating trends in England and America at the time, is unique in Australia, being the only one of radial design still intact.

The building's historical values are of primary importance, enhanced by their expression in the architectural forms and decorative treatments of the building, which remain evident despite the large number of changes that have occurred over time. These values are principally evident in the external and internal fabric of the front section of Elder House, (beneath the hipped roof), where they are substantially intact, and in the ground floor and Boardroom / Executive Suite areas at first and third floor levels.

In addition, it is of considerable architectural interest for being the only structure designed in South Australia by the architect Robin Boyd, who achieved international renown. Born in Melbourne in 1919 into a family of well-known artists, Boyd became renowned as an architect of the 'new breed' of the 1950s who aspired to develop a functional style suited to the Australian climate and lifestyle. He wrote several widely acclaimed books including 'Australia's Home' (1952) and his attack on unimaginative architecture, 'The Australian Ugliness' (1960).

Charles Hervey Bagot, prominent early South Australian colonist, parliamentarian and pastoralist, and a founder of the Kapunda Copper Mine, one of the earliest mines in the colony. Since its construction Nurney House has been the home for various generations of the Bagot family. Around 1930 the original 1847 two-storey residence was enlarged and extensively remodelled in an eclectic Italianate style by Captain Bagot's great grandson, influential South Australian architect Walter Hervey Bagot, for his own residence. The southern courtyard, loggia and garden created as part of the c.1930 alterations add considerably to the distinctiveness of the building and are of particular architectural interest, as this concept was unique for its period within South Australia. The detailing of the interior of the house is also notable, due to features such as panelled vaults, highly decorated ceilings and cornices. After receiving his formal architectural training in Europe, Walter Hervey Bagot became a partner in the prominent Adelaide architectural practice Woods, Bagot, Jory and Laybourne Smith, which was responsible for the design of many of the major public buildings in South Australia from early in the twentieth century. A great admirer of Italian art and architecture, Bagot lectured on Italian art at the Art Gallery of South Australia and founded the Australian-Italian Society. He was a commissioner of the National Park at Belair and a governor of the Botanic Garden. The remodelling of Nurney House to resemble an Italian villa reflects Bagot's personal skills and interests and is an outstanding example of the work of this renowned South Australian architect.

The Chimney and the disinfector building are the only surviving elements of the former complex, which once comprised a refuse destructor, a tin baling press, clinker mill, mortar mill and flagmaking plant. Improvements in technology during the latter part of the nineteenth century meant that the refuse destructor became a popular method of waste disposal in England, Australia and New Zealand. It was perceived as being both efficient and profitable. The profit arose from the use of the by-products of the disposal process, such as clinker, and from the conversion of the heat generated by the furnace to steam. The Adelaide complex used the steam to disinfect laundry and to generate electricity. This was the main form of waste disposal in Adelaide until 1952, when the land fill system was chosen."

The Adelaide Festival of Arts had been the first of its kind in Australia, a bold vision which became an enduring event, marking South Australia as the 'Festival State'. The erection of the Adelaide Festival Centre was an equally bold move. Innovative in style, the achievement of both Liberal and Labour governments, the Adelaide City Council and notable individuals, the complex is a home for the Festival, and a cultural centre for the people of South Australia. The Centre has received much critical acclaim as an extremely functional performing arts complex. The Centre is an unashamedly modern complex notable for its bold structuralist approach to form. The multi-purpose Festival Theatre, the more intimate drama theatre (Playhouse), the experimental theatre (Space) and the Amphitheatre are integrated successfully by roof form and the formality of the dominant octagonal module. The individual components of the complex are noted for their versatility, the appeal of internal spaces, the quality of finishes, the good acoustics and the planning of seating and facilities which are held in high regard by artists and patrons alike. The complex has been criticised as 'strident' in colour and finish. Concern has also been expressed that the Festival Theatre and Playhouse Theatre express themselves as concrete buildings whereas they are in fact steel framed. There are also some serious structural faults. Yet the complex as a whole is genuinely historic and the architecture may be regarded as progressive while reflecting the period in which the concept was first mooted. The Hajek sculpture plaza and recent additions such as the larger restaurant and conference centre are not as happily related, the plaza in particular butting uncomfortably against the exposed northern wall of Parliament House.

The sanatorium, the first of its kind in Adelaide to have the doctor residing in the building and always in attendance, was arranged, managed and equipped in the most up to date manner, the result of Hynes' overseas travel and study. The building was acquired by the South Australian Government in 1911 and has since accommodated a succession of State government departments.

This Regiment has had a particularly illustrious career on the battle front: in Gallipoli and France in World War One, and in Tobruk and New Guinea in World War Two. The Torrens Training Depot was built in 1936 and is an excellent example of the Inter-War Stripped Classical style of architecture in Adelaide, particularly as interpreted by architects working for the Commonwealth Government. The strictly symmetrical design of the building and its low scale with simplified classical motifs and Art Deco decorative elements make this one of the most notable buildings in Adelaide of this style to be constructed pre World War Two. The internal arrangement of the building typifies the functional organisation of the Army and its physical requirements. All external detailing which is original to the 1936 building is significant. Internally the open unrestricted form of the drill hall is the most significant aspect.

It was dedicated to 'Australasians' and therefore included New Zealanders, where most other war memorials were dedicated to Australians or local men who served and/or died. The support within the Adelaide community for its erection within the Wattle Grove (its original location) testifies to the intense support contemporary South Australians had for those fighting at Gallipoli and the impact of the war on the community.

The former warehouse (1878), is historically significant for its direct association with the large South Australian merchant firm of G & R Wills & Co. Founded in 1849, the company traded throughout Australia, with branches in three States, as well as extensive Adelaide operations including clothing and shoe factories and their import business. Designed by Daniel Garlick, the three-storey building is of masonry construction with classical Italianate stucco detailing which is particularly decorative for a commercial building. Its architectural significance is enhanced by the high integrity of both the exterior and interior, with most of the fabric remaining in near original condition. Slender cast iron columns allow undivided space on all three floors, and are an important feature of the interiors. The warehouse forms a pair with a similar building located on its western side, which was constructed for G & R Wills & Co some years earlier. The smaller neo-Gothic styled building to the east is one of the few to survive to represent the former professional and residential nature of North Terrace. Designed by E J Woods in 1901 as a dwelling and consulting rooms for noted Adelaide eye surgeon Dr Mark Johnston Symons, it continued to be used primarily as medical consulting rooms until the 1940s when part of the building was acquired by John Martin & Co for use as a store. The building is of architectural significance because of its exceptionally high integrity, both internally and externally, and its ability to give an insight into early twentieth century medical practices through the retention of original room layouts and finishes, including features such as the tiled 'operating room' and large waiting rooms.

The subdivision demonstrates with great style the manner in which parts of North Adelaide were developed and is one of the few subdivisions to remain relatively intact and easily identifiable. The redevelopment occurred in the last years of South Australia's greatest boom period and was one of the largest and last speculative initiatives encouraged by the financial successes of the period. There are two plan forms in this subdivision - detached villas and semidetached villas. The detached villas are representative of the type of building which gives North Adelaide much of its distinctive character with asymmetrically placed bays and balconies. The semidetached villas are more eclectically detailed with unusual balcony and veranda forms. Their 'boom' style detailing is distinctive, with few peers in Adelaide.

The house is historically associated with Charles (later Sir Charles) Henry Goode, for whom it was built in 1907, and it effectively commemorates the mercantile success of Goode and his softgoods company Goode Durrant and Co., considered one of the colony's leading business houses. Goode attained prominence as a successful businessman and Member of Parliament, but was best known as a philanthropist and tireless worker for numerous social welfare causes. Amongst other contributions, he was a founder of the Royal Institution for the Blind, the South Australian Adult Deaf and Dumb Mission, the Adelaide Children's Hospital and the Adelaide YMCA. The house is a significant example of Federation period architecture. It is well detailed internally and externally, displaying a disciplined eclecticism in its combination of picturesque and classically derived elements. The fireplaces and overmantels are particularly notable in this regard.
