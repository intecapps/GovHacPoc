It has the very unusual feature of cropped photographic prints of men's faces collaged to the painted figures (the original is held in the Adelaide City Council Civic collection archive Civic Collection item: CC000027). This item is a photographic image from a glass plate negative of artist James Shaw's original painting, showing Adelaide society dancing at the Opening Ball at the Adelaide Town Hall. Kept with this item is a Christmas card from the Lord Mayor, Lady Mayoress, Aldermen and Councillors dated Christmas, 1950, which has included a copy of this image. Inscribed on the back of photograph are the words 'Opening Ball, Adelaide Town Hall. June 22, 1866. From an oil painting made by J. Shaw in 1867 (Vide plate on original picture at the Adelaide Town Hall). Shaw made a sketch of the event on June 22, 1866, using an architectural plan for details of the interior (vide S.A.

The gasoliers at the Town Hall, however, were probably not installed on the occasion depicted, these fittings, newly arrived from England, being apparently placed into general use for the first time on Aug. 21, 1866.
